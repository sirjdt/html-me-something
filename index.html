<h2>Prince</h2>
<p>Prince is a Siamese cat I adopted from a shelter 15 years ago in Anchorage, Alaska. He is extremely clingy and talkative. Despite putting him on a diet for his obesity he always manages to steal my dog's food.</p>

<h2>Nemo and Dory</h2>
<p> I came into possession of these two Domestic Shorthairs within the same month. The one on the left is Nemo: he was a stray cat who hid under the shed outside my home. The one on the right is Dory: she was adopted to keep Nemo company since he and Prince didn't get along. Nemo is very chill while Dory is very needy and eats the other cats' food. </article>

<h2>Skipper</h2>
<p>Skipper is a stray black cat who visits a few times a week. He's very elusive but manages to eat all the food I leave out for him. Hopefully he doesn't give me bad luck in exchange for my generosity.</article>
